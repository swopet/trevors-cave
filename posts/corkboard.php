	<p>My brother (Carson Swope) and I collaborated to participate in the Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam 2021, and made a little puzzle game called Corkboard in 48 hours. Music was made by Madison Butler a.k.a. Wahx (also in 48 hours!!!); check out more of his stuff <a href = https://open.spotify.com/album/0Kc34LaMr35wC4iXvl3ocu?si=onwm0gLcStyrAnCwNusG-Q>here</a>.</p>
